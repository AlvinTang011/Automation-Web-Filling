# Automation-Web-Filling
A mini project to understand how to interact with the chrome broswer via coding

readme file created by Tang Kai Wen, Alvin

# Prerequisite
Python


# Information
The current auto.exe will fill up the form with a randomly generated temparature, a template NRIC "S8462840I", and a template email "tester@gmail.com"
In order to change it, open auto.py in an editor and change the commented portion

# Note
For all testing and purposes, this is only a fun challenge for myself to understand how to use python to interact with a browser to automate things

The website we will be filling up is https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e3ebefa5203c3001108b7ba
